# Wide3

**Wide3** is a collaborative organization designed to build, manage and scale complex projects through a decentralized yet coordinated operating model. It combines strategic guidance, distributed execution and transparent financial flows to deliver value efficiently and sustainably.

---

## 🌐 What is Wide3?

Wide3 operates as an organizational and financial framework rather than a traditional company. Projects are executed by independent contributors and groups, coordinated through shared rules, governance principles and operational models.

At the core of Wide3 is the **BIT Model**, which defines how projects are structured, governed and financially managed.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### BIT Model

The **BIT Model** (Business Integration & Transformation) is the operational backbone of Wide3. It defines:

* How projects are initiated and governed
* How responsibilities are distributed
* How value creation is measured
* How financial flows are managed

The client interacts with a single reference entity while the execution is carried out by multiple contributors behind the scenes.

### Guide Group (GG)

The **Guide Group (GG)** is the central coordination unit for each project. Its responsibilities include:

* Strategic guidance and oversight
* Client relationship management

From the client’s perspective, the GG is the only counterpart.

### Contributors

Contributors are individuals, teams or entities involved in delivering specific parts of a project

## 🏛 Governance

Wide3 is governed by:

* A shared **Statute** defining principles, roles and decision-making processes
* Project-specific agreements aligned with the BIT Model
* Clear separation between governance, coordination and execution

Governance is designed to be:

* Lightweight
* Transparent
* Adaptable to different project scales
