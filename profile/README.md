# Wide3

**Wide3** is a collaborative organization designed to build, manage and scale complex projects through a decentralized yet coordinated operating model. It combines strategic guidance, distributed execution, and transparent financial flows to deliver value efficiently and sustainably.

---

## 🌐 What is Wide3?

Wide3 operates as an organizational and financial framework rather than a traditional company. Projects are executed by independent contributors and groups, coordinated through shared rules, governance principles, and operational models.

At the core of Wide3 is the **BIT Model**, which defines how projects are structured, governed, and financially managed.

---

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### BIT Model

The **BIT Model** (Business Integration & Transformation) is the operational backbone of Wide3. It defines:

* How projects are initiated and governed
* How responsibilities are distributed
* How value creation is measured
* How financial flows are managed

The client interacts with a single reference entity while the execution is carried out by multiple contributors behind the scenes.

### Guide Group (GG)

The **Guide Group (GG)** is the central coordination unit for each project. Its responsibilities include:

* Strategic guidance and oversight
* Client relationship management
* Collection of invoices from project contributors
* Issuing a single invoice to the client
* Distributing payments to contributors according to the BIT Model rules

From the client’s perspective, the GG is the only counterpart.

### Contributors

Contributors are individuals, teams, or entities involved in delivering specific parts of a project. They:

* Operate independently
* Invoice the Guide Group (not the client)
* Are paid according to predefined agreements and project rules

---

## 💸 Financial Flow (High-Level)

1. Client receives a **single invoice** from the Guide Group
2. Client pays only the Guide Group
3. Contributors issue invoices to the Guide Group
4. The Guide Group pays contributors based on the BIT Model allocation

This structure ensures:

* Simplicity for the client
* Transparency for contributors
* Compliance with standard accounting practices

---

## 🏛 Governance

Wide3 is governed by:

* A shared **Statute** defining principles, roles, and decision-making processes
* Project-specific agreements aligned with the BIT Model
* Clear separation between governance, coordination, and execution

Governance is designed to be:

* Lightweight
* Transparent
* Adaptable to different project scales

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

This GitHub organization hosts:

* Documentation of the BIT Model
* Governance and statutory documents
* Project templates and operational guidelines
* Shared tools and utilities

Each repository should include its own README explaining scope, ownership, and contribution rules.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

* Review the governance and BIT Model documentation
